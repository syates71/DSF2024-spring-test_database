I have over 20 years of clinical data management experience starting in 2001 as a Data Manager for the Botswana-Harvard Partnership for HIV/AIDS Research &amp; Education in Botswana, primarily working on anti-retroviral treatment trials. Upon returning to the U.S. in 2019, I now support the Petersen HIV Clinics in the College of Medicine as a Data Specialist, Senior. </p> <p>My passions are database development and ensuring collected data support the clinical project or program. I hope to leverage clinical trial metadata to better inform clinical researchers of their project\u2019s status, improve data quality, and provide enhanced monitoring techniques.</p>"}]}
